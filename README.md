# 100 Days of Code Blog - Web Application

[Application Live on Heroku](https://code100blog.herokuapp.com)

This repo contains code for a web app I developed as part of the [100 Days of Code challenge](http://100daysofcode.com). The app is a relatively
simple blog-type app which allows people to log their progress during the 100 Days of Code challenge. The app was
written in Python/Django.
